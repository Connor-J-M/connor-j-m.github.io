        <h3>Mission Statement:</h3>
  Students Ending Mental Illness Stigmas 
  strives to raise 
  awareness about mental 
  illness and other mental health issues. 
  It is our goal to eliminate harmful misconceptions about this 
  important but highly 
  stigmatized issue. We engage in honest discussions about mental 
  health, educate on topics related 
  to it, and provide stress relief themed events to 
  promote self care.
